* way too long (~1h!!)
  - could have only 1 live example? don't go through the simple client/server
    example live, just show traffic dump
  - practice and get the intro really simple and tight, limit it to 5-10min
    before you dive into examples
  - combine slides for me+company intro, limit to 2min

* add one quick slide mentioning how websocket clients work in JS (maybe have
  the client for the example be a JS client rather than a python client)
