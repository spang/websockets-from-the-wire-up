To set up to give this talk...

[] export slides to LibreOffice, then PDF (don't present from LO since it's
   hard to resume after switching to a terminal)
[] change your terminal profile to "Presentation" (solarized colourscheme
   looks TERRIBLE on a projector)
[] bring up ws_server.py (fg) and ws_client.py (bg) in vim (not in split mode
   because it's too wide)
[] open websocket_simple.dump in wireshark
[] do `vagrant up` in `browserquest`, and `cd /vagrant` and fire up `node
   server/js/main.js`

Beforehand, review these things to get in the right brain-space:

[] the public notes on the talk (in HaikuDeck)
[] UNIX sockets
[] websocket packet layout, details about opcodes, etc. (all in RFC6455)
[] how websockets deal with firewalls and proxies (details about mask)
[] meditate for 20min, focusing on long, slow inhales and exhales. helps with
   the ums and uhs and calms responses to questions.

And don't forget to practice the talk in chunks (intro, demos, conclusion)
and at least once all the way through during the week leading up. :) Say the
actual words you will say!  Make eye contact and, when explaining something,
speak to a single person. Pause.
